## 1. [Logs Analysis](https://github.com/wendyfu/udacity-full-stack-web-dev/tree/master/logs-analysis)
_You've been hired onto a team working on a newspaper site. The user-facing newspaper site frontend itself, and the database behind it, are already built and running. You've been asked to build an internal reporting tool that will use information from the database to discover what kind of articles the site's readers like._

_The database contains newspaper articles, as well as the web server log for the site. The log has a database row for each time a reader loaded a web page. Using that information, your code will answer questions about the site's user activity._

_The program you write in this project will run from the command line. It won't take any input from the user. Instead, it will connect to that database, use SQL queries to analyze the log data, and print out the answers to some questions._

## 3. [Neighborhood Map](https://github.com/wendyfu/udacity-full-stack-web-dev/tree/master/neighborhood-map)

## 4. [Linux Deployment](https://github.com/wendyfu/udacity-full-stack-web-dev/tree/master/linux-deployment)
_You will take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host your web applications. You will secure your server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of your existing web applications onto it._
